SigmaSrc
Skidma (Sigma) 4.1.1 source code. 

Pretty much the source code of Sigma Client. Compile it by dragging mcpcoder pack into the extracted SigmaSrc folder and running the batch file named decompile.

Have fun skidding bypasses

disclaimer: i wasnt the person who got the source code, just putting it out in the public
